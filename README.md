# 🔬 Scientific Modeling Projects

Where old school math meets machine learning magic. These projects mix **classic models** like SIR and TSP with modern AI to simulate pandemics, optimize routes, and flex that brainpower across disciplines. Data science? More like data *alchemy* 🧪.

### 🧭 [Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with ML + Heuristics ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/tsp-hybrid-optimizer)

Gave the classic TSP a glow-up. Combined **reinforcement learning**, greedy heuristics, and graph search to crack one of the hardest problems in logistics. It’s like Google Maps, but smarter (and built by me).

### 🦠 [Epidemiological Modeling: SIR + Machine Learning ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/disease-forecasting-sir-ml)

Modeled how diseases spread using the **SIR model**, then leveled it up with machine learning to forecast outbreaks. Stats + ML = public health prediction on point.
